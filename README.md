# Transformers_Bank_lending_chatbox
A chatbox implementation for bank lending through Transformers architecture

## Objective: 
Develop a domain-specific chatbot using a generative architecture and Transformer models. The chatbot must understand and respond to user queries effectively within its domain. 
Project Phases: 
1 Domain Choice: 
- Choose a specific application or domain for your chatbot (e.g., customer service, e-commerce, reservations and bookings, etc.). 
- Define the scope of the chatbot, e.g., a customer service chatbot for a specific product, a movie recommendation chatbot, etc. 
2. Data collection and preparation: 
- Collect a corpus of dialogs relevant to your domain. This can be collected from online resources, simulated or created with classmates. 
- Clean and pre-process the data: remove duplicates, correct typos, tokenize and format the data uniformly. 
3. Design and architecture: 
- Model architecture: Generative using Transformer models.
- Choose between Keras (with TensorFlovv backend) or PyTorch for implementation.
- Decide which Transformer variant or library to use (e.g., BERT, GPT-2, etc.).
- Define the input and output formats for your chatbot.
 4. Implementation: 
- Implement the architecture of the Transformer model using the chosen framework.
- Train the model using the prepared data.
- Handle tokenization, attention mechanisms and other Transformer nuances.
- Implement any additional features, such as maintaining context or refining token handling. 
5. Evaluation: 
- Test the chatbot with users unfamiliar with its design. 
- Gather feedback on its accuracy, speed and overall user experience.
- Refine and improve the chatbot based on the feedback.
6. Documentation and presentation:
- Document the design, architecture and challenges the project faced.
- Create a short presentation highlighting the chatbot features, demonstration and findings from the user testing phase. 

## Deliverables: 
Project report: a comprehensive report detailing the entire process, from domain selection to final evaluation 2. Include challenges faced, solutions implemented and future enhancements. 
2. Chatbot Demo: A working demo of your chatbot, on any other platform. 
3. Presentation: A 10-15 minute presentation about your project, showing its features, user feedback and your earnings. 
 

## Evaluation criteria: 
1. Relevance to the chosen domain: How well the chatbot serves your intended users.
 2. Technical competence: The effectiveness of the chosen Transformer model, the proper use of Keras/PyTorch and the overall implementation. 
3. User Experience: The chatbot's ability to understand user queries, provide relevant answers, and maintain context.
4. Innovation: Any unique features or approaches used in the chatbot. 
5. Documentation and presentation: Clarity, completeness and consistency of the project report and presentation. 
## Tips: 
-Collaborate and brainstorm with your peers for creative ideas.
- Since Transformer's architecture can be complex, make sure you understand its intricacies, such as self-attention and positional coding. 
- Regularly test your chatbot during development to catch problems early on.
